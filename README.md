## OCHS

The [Oxford Centre for Hindu Studies Online](https://ochsonline.org/) provides excellent course material and instruction on topics that I find myself deeply interested in.

In particular, I have been taking their courses on the Sanskrit language taught by Zoë Slatoff and based off of her incredible textbook, *[Yogāvatāraṇam: The Translation of Yoga](https://www.ashtangayogasanskrit.com/yogavataranam-yoga-sanskrit-and-philosophy/)*.

If you are interested in learning Sanskrit, I can't recommend her courses and textbook highly enough.
